                <p>Installed SoloLearn app and started 'HTML fundamentals' course.</p>
                <p>Coding basic web pages with content, always start with "Hello World" ;-)</p>

                <p>Now working on CSS, thats all about making your content look good.</p>
                <p>Gonna style up some pages I've been working on, including this Blog/Journal.</p>

                <p><b>November 2019</b></p>
                <p>Attended the AO Tech Conference in Bolton on the 9th. What a great place and met some great people, learnt loads, and got inspired to keep on working hard!!! </p>
                <p>Here's where real programming begins, HELLO JavaScript. Going to use Codecademy's free course on JS fundamentals aswell as JS Tutorial on SoloLearn to supplement.</p>

                <p><b>December 2019</b></p>
                <p>Watching some youtube Tutorials to help me get to grips with JS. Check out 'Mosh JS Tutorials', really helps with understanding.  Nearly completed the JS module on the app.  Lots more to do on Codecademy, 50% complete though.</p>

                <p><b>January 2020</b></p>
                <p>Just attended a Code Nation open evening. A coding bootcamp which sounds fantastic. Got a copy of their syllabus so I can see what I need to study next and what I need to work on. Needed this to keep the focus!</p>
                <p>Signed up to attend a 'meetup' at the end of this month by 'MancJS' which is about 'productive ways to speed-up your coding'.  Really looking forward to that. Also signed up to monthly 'meetups' with CodeUp, keeping the motivation alive! Hoping that each month I can learn more and contribute.  As one of my dear teachers said "Learn to Teach, Teach to Learn".  A well known principle on how teaching/relaying what you've learnt helps with embedding and understanding.</p>
                <p>Working on securing work experience at AO in my mid-term hols in Feb.</p>
