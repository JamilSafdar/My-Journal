		<p>So this is me, Jamil, hence the logo (Jamils CODE).  38 years of age, embarking on a coding journey, and here's why.  I'm currently working in a primary special needs school and have done so since graduation from MMU in 2004.  Think its defo time to move on and learn new things, and besides, don't think I'll be able to physically manage the behaviour for much longer.  These kids are strong, and sometimes unpredictable!</p>
		<p>Time to plan ahead! Speaking to a friend about future plans, he mentioned he was a Web Dev and to check out coding. Fast Forward 2 months later... I have completed HTML 5, CSS 3 fundamentals, and currently half way though Codecademy's course on Javascript.  It's great learning new things and its sooo cool when things start functioning.</p>

		<p><span><b>December 2019</b></span></p>
		<p>My next step is to start applying for Web Dev apprenticeships, if that FAILs (First Attempt In Learning), I will continue self studying and apply for jobs til someone gives me a chance! Can't afford to pay 6k for a bootcamp, got 3 kids under 10 to feed (and I mean FEED!) and clothe!</p>
